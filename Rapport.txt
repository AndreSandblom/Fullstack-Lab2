Labb 2 Fullstack Course- Andr√© Sandblom

Challanges- 
Since setting up the backend feelt more comfortable from the last Labb 1 learnings but was still a challange to grasp.
And using React for the first time was also a learning curve understandning the framwork itself but also using both html and js in the same file.
Had some problems seeing my data in react app since i made stupid misstake of only keep starting the backend while wondering why nothing was showing in the frontend.

Solutions and Learnings-
Except for the stupid easy misstakes the solution i feelt were quite straightforward after understanding to set up my frontend with my backend.
And also getting starting with React i slowly grasp the basics but with any new framework there is a long way to being able to work indepenent on it.
But working with JS and html in generel wasnt that hard. 

Would I do anything differently-
First thing i did after being done with this labb was to recreate our base folder for the groupproject.
with all the new knowledge on how to sett up the root directory splitted in server side and client.
While keeping the orginisation going for components while also splitting up the controller, models and routes for example.
